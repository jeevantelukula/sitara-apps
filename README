Sitara Applications
===================

Cloning sources
-------------------
The sitara-apps repo uses git submodules. Use one of the following set of
commands to fetch all sources:

    $ git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.itg.ti.com/sitara/sitara-apps.git
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

Or to clone in a single command:

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules ssh://git@bitbucket.itg.ti.com/sitara/sitara-apps.git


Configuring sitara-apps for building
-------------------
The file `Rules.make` is provided to configure paths to dependencies provided by
Processor SDK. These paths can be set to either build against the Sitara SDK
which provides both RTOS and Linux packages, or the individual Processor SDK for
RTOS and Linux each.

Variables expected to be modified:

If building agaisnt the Sitara SDK:
* `PSDK_PATH`: install directory of the Sitara SDK


If building against the Processor SDK:

*This should only be used for experimental purposes. All pull requests must be
validated against the Sitara SDK.*

* `PRSDK_PATH`: install directory of the Processor SDK for Baremetal/RTOS.
* `PLSDK_PATH`: install directory of the Processor SDK for Linux


Building sitara-apps
-------------------
The sitara-apps can be built using the Makefile contained in the top directory.
Once the paths have been configured as specified above, the following command
will build all demo applications.

    $ make

To see a more verbose output for debugging, the following command may be used to
see compile/linking commands:

    $ make SHOW_COMMANDS=1


Using Concerto:
-------------------
For an introduction and overview of Concerto, please refer to the README under
the concerto directory.

For example usage, please refer to the following files in the servo-drive-demo:
* `apps/servo_drive_demo/Makefile`: top-level makefile for invoking concerto.
* `apps/servo_drive_demo/ethercat_loop/src/concerto.mak`: example sub-makefile for building a TI RTOS application
* `apps/servo_drive_demo/position_speed_loop/src/concerto.mak`: example sub-makefile for building a baremetal application
