Position Speed Loop for AM65x Servo Drive Demo
==============================================
The code included in this folder is a port of the master node in the C2000
Multi-axis TI Design: 
[Distributed multi-axis servo drive over fast serial interface (FSI) reference design](http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDM-02006 "TIDM-02006")

The C2000 code for the demo is provided here (v3.00.00.00 is used in our demo):

PRU FSI Emulation on AM65x
--------------------------
Developing this demo on AM65x is a path to pre-silicon development for AM64x.
One major IP that AM65x lacks is hardware FSI. To overcome this limitation
during development prototype PRU firmwares were developed. The goal of the PRU
firmwares is to mimic the FSI register set using ICSSG memories and send and
receive FSI frames accordingly. Pre-built binaries of the PRU firmwares are
provided in this repository at:
```
sitara_apps/apps/servo_drive_demo/position_speed_loop/include/PRU_FSI_Receive.h
sitara_apps/apps/servo_drive_demo/position_speed_loop/include/PRU_FSI_Transmit.h
```
Source code to recreate the two binaries can be found in the pru_proof_of_concepts/pru_fsi
repository on bitbucket (am65x_fsi_csl branch @ commit a8320d87395 to match this repo commit):
[PRU Proof of Concepts: PRU FSI prototype](https://bitbucket.itg.ti.com/projects/PPOC/repos/pru_fsi/browse "PRU FSI Prototype")

To rebuild the firmwares use Code Composer Studio to import the CCS project
files found in the 'PRU_FSI_Recieve' (sic) and 'PRU_FSI_Transmit' directories.
